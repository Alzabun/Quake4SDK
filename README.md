# Quake 4 - Rhythm Mod 

## Description:

This mod keeps Quake 4 as an FPS shooter but with a twist. Rather than firing a gun without any timing other than the fire rate, you have to shoot to the rhythm! In this case, rhythm refers to the BPM of a song. You are rewarded/penalized depending on your performance, being how close you are to the beat of the song playing.

## Instructions:

The default song that plays is called Devil Trigger by Ali Edwards, originally from the game Devil May Cry 5. 
This song has a BPM of 160, and the beat of this song is loud and clear.

### If you want to change the music:

Make sure your audio file for the song you want to use is a 32-bit OGG at either 11025 HZ, 22050 HZ, or 44100 HZ. Audacity can be used to check or edit this. Afterward, go to the mod files in "mods\sound\marine\player" and replace custom_music.ogg with your audio file.

If you don't know the BPM of the song you want to use, this mod provides a new command in-game which calculates any BPM depending on your song of choice. To do this, first load into any game and make sure you have the blaster equipped. Next, open the console (CTRL + Alt + `) and run the command "calculatebpm". Begin shooting the blaster to the beat of the song you are listening to then re-enter the command once you think you did enough. **(NOTE: THERE IS A LIMIT OF 100 TAPS)**. Afterwards, the BPM will be automatically set and from here you can follow the remaining instructions to start the mod.

If you know the BPM of the song you want beforehand, just open the game and set the BPM you found by opening the console and type in "setbpm [insert BPM amount here]".
Now from here just follow the instructions of the default music.

### How To Begin The Mod:

Once you are in the game, as in you, the player, have spawned, open the console (CTRL + Alt + `) and type "preparemusic". The rhythm mechanics and the song will activate so the mod can start.
