# Quake 4 - Rhythm Mod 

## Description:

This mod keeps Quake 4 as an FPS shooter but with a twist. Rather than firing a gun without any timing other than the fire rate, you have to shoot to the rhythm! In this case, rhythm refers to the BPM of a song. You are rewarded/penalized depending on your performance, being how close you are to the beat of the song playing.

## Instructions:

### If you want to change the music:

Have an MP3 of the file you want to use first and go to this [website](https://getsongbpm.com/tools/audio) to find the BPM of your song or google it alternatively. 
After you get the BPM, now make sure your audio file is a 32-bit OGG at either 11025 HZ, 22050 HZ, or 44100 HZ. Audacity can be used to check or edit this.
Afterward, go to the mod files in "mods\sound\marine\player" and replace custom_music.ogg with your audio file.
Open the game and set the BPM you found by opening the console (CTRL + Alt + `) and type in "setbpm [insert BPM amount here]" without the quotes obviously.
Now from here just follow the instructions of the default music.

### If not / you did change the music:

Once you are in the game, as in you, the player, have spawned, open the console (CTRL + Alt + `) and type "preparemusic". The rhythm mechanics and the song will activate so the mod can start. 

The default song that plays is called Devil Trigger by Ali Edwards, originally from the game Devil May Cry 5. 
This song has a BPM of 160, and the beat of this song is loud and clear.

## Deliverables:

Weapons limited/enhanced based on timing with the Beat
