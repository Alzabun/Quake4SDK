# Quake 4 - Rhythm Mod 

## Description:

This mod keeps Quake 4 as an FPS shooter but with a twist. Rather than shooting without any timing other than the fire rate, you have to shoot to the rhythm! In this case, rhythm refers to the BPM of a song. You are rewarded/penalized depending on your performance of how close you are to the beat of the song playing.

## Instructions:

Load into a new game or any map as the mod will automatically activate as long as you, the player, is alive. The default song that plays is called Devil Trigger by Ali Edwards, originally from the game Devil May Cry 5. This song has a BPM of 160, and the beat of this song is loud and clear. Alternatively, you can add your own song by going to [somewhere] and replacing the filename of the song in there which the code will automatically find the BPM of.

## Deliverables:

Extract the BPM for at least 2 songs to showcase the system (will hopefully be completed by the due date)

Weapons limited/enhanced based on timing with the Beat

Rhythm-based combos for rewards

10 Rewards / Perks earned through performance

~~Monsters spawning in waves~~ (most likely won't be completed by the due date)
